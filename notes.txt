# GitGuard Checkpoints vs Git Reflog

## Git Reflog
- **Mechanism:** Records a local history of where your HEAD reference has been.
- **Intent:** Implicit logging of all movements (commits, resets, checkouts).
- **Persistence:** Entries expire (default 90 days) and can be garbage collected.
- **Usage:** Requires searching through logs (`git reflog`) to find the specific index (e.g., `HEAD@{5}`) to restore.
- **Scope:** strictly local to the machine.

## GitGuard Checkpoints
- **Mechanism:** Creates an explicit, named backup branch (`gitguard-backup-TIMESTAMP`).
- **Intent:** Active safety measure created *before* a risky operation is executed by the tool.
- **Persistence:** Durable branches that exist until explicitly deleted. They are not subject to reflog expiration.
- **Usage:** "One-Click" undo via `gitguard rollback`. The tool tracks exactly which backup corresponds to the last operation.
- **Scope:** While currently local, branches *could* be pushed to a remote for backup (though GitGuard keeps them local by default).
